1. Introduction

Upholding the tradition of getting free things: doing less work for more.
While, hopefully, not sacrificing the safety or efficiency of our programs,
or even improving them.

Examples of generalizability can be on a foundational level, like having polymorphism, be it parametric or ad-hoc (duck-typing doesn&#39;t count).
Another way to get generality can be through generics/reflection (meta-programming).

For a part, safety automatically happens when you don&#39;t have duck-typing, pointers, unsafe coercion, incomplete pattern matching/non-total functions, non-termination, ...
You can get more safety/certainty about your code by testing it, but why would you extensively (and never exhaustively) test your code, when you can also &quot;just&quot; explain why the code works?
We can achieve this by constraining the types of our programs to enforce their behaviour, or by adapting different (more methodical) methods of &quot;synthesizing code&quot;.

The catch is that we&#39;re in (Cubical) Agda so efficiency isn&#39;t something that happens in the code we write per se.
The aim is to start from simple and safe implementations, to switch to more efficient/complex implementations,
but then generalize the safety proofs from the simple to the complex case.
After this, we can (attempt) to erase the (Cubical) from Agda, and then agda2hs the Agda into Haskell and hope it still runs, but is now safe and quick.


2. Questions
2.1. Can we transport proofs of functions on unary naturals to binary naturals?
A: Yes (3.1).


2.2. Can we derive (efficient) implementations from simple specifications?
A: Requires a bunch of work even for simple examples, but no failure yet (3.2).


2.3. Can we lift `_+_` to `_++_`
A: Yes (Transporting Functions across Ornaments)

2.4. Can we get associativity of `_++_` from associativity of `_+_`?
A: No! (4.1).

2.5 For `(X Y : Desc I)`/`(X : Orn D, Y : Orn E)` when is `(mu X ~ mu Y)`/`(mu ceil(X) ~ mu ceil(Y))`?
For `X : Orn D` and `mu D ~ mu E`, what is the corresponding `Y : Orn E`?
A: Unanswered. (5.1).

2.6. Does (2.1) generalize to other datastructures?
A: Probably.

2.7. Can we generalize calculating datastructures a bit?
A: Yes! (at least the case of nested n-ary trees) (3.3). 

2.8. Can we get a more categorical picture of the state of affairs? E.g. `Vec A n` is a monoid displayed over the monoid of natural numbers. (Check this in the Cubical discord).
A: Unanswered.

2.9. Can we instantiate the appropriate relations on `X` and `Y` to get `X / ~X = Y / ~Y` from their description as (co)-algebras, or simply maps `f, g: X &lt;-&gt; Y`?
A: The former is unanswered. The answer to the latter is somewhat trivially positive (3.4).

2.10. Can we make SIP work with records as structures?
A: I hope so. (Simply describe a record `X` such that `X ~ mu XDesc`, where `mu XDesc` is workable with SIP).

2.11. How am I going to typeset this?
A: :(


3. Positive answers
3.1. Proof transport

This might sound a bit dream-like, so some (simple) demonstration is in order.

3.2. Optimizing definitions from specifications

Can we define functions (on more intricate types) by their behaviour (on simpler types), without sacrificing too much efficiency?
We can try:

pred : Leibniz -&gt; Leibniz
pred = fromN . pred . [[_]]

pred n = fromN (pred [[ n ]])

pred 0b     = fromN (pred [[ 0b ]]) = 0
pred (x 1b) = fromN (pred [[ 1b x ]]) = fromN (pred (1 + 2 * [[ x ]])) = fromN (2 * [[ x ]]) = double x
pred (x 2b) = fromN (pred [[ 2b x ]]) = fromN (pred (2 + 2 * [[ x ]])) = fromN (1 + 2 * [[ x ]]) = x 1b

Ok..., but what about double?

double : Leibniz -&gt; Leibniz
double n = fromN (double [[ n ]])

double 0b     = 0
double (x 1b) = fromN (double [[ 1b x ]]) = fromN (double (1 + 2 * [[ x ]])) = fromN (2 + 2 * [[ double x ]]) = double x 2b
double (x 2b) = fromN (double (2 + 2 * [[ x ]])) = fromN (2 + 2 + 2 * 2 * [[ x ]]) = fromN (2 + 2 * (1 + 2 * [[ x ]])) = x 1b 2b

Not sure if this is very convincing.


3.3. Ornamenting n-ary binary numbers.

Smooth sailing modulo encoding overhead.
Succesfully described n-ary (zeroless) binary numbers and ornaments on them to get their associated index type and array type.

As we can see, it works, but at best it saves you some space by not having to write down the forget and the relation separately. 
That is, if you&#39;re trying to hit your intended datatypes on the nose, you&#39;re going to have to prove that your map was injective/surjective to begin with, which is just as much work as proving the equivalence directly.



4. Negative answers
4.1. Lifting properties along ornaments.

Pretty disastrous.
E.g. associativity need not be preserved by arbitrary coherent lifts, like `_+_` -&gt; `_++_` does not stop us from swapping elements.

Likewise, the type of patching `_+_` to vector `_++_` pretty clearly still allows such pathological patches (I think, actually decoding the type is virtually impossible).

One would need something impractically strong like a traversable (and more) to hope to lift properties.
Perhaps if we restrict to morphisms that cannot see contents?



5. Unanswered
5.1. Relations between ornaments from equivalences of their fixpoints.

For the former, hardly anything reduces. For the latter, similarly `mu D ~ mu E` says very little about `D`, whence correspondence between `X` and `Y` is hardly controlled by this.
